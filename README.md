# pucks

A clojure project for development and simulation of a laser projector.
Work in progress, but 100% done in Clojure (my favorite language).
One day will be converted to an opensource library for CAD and simulation of any type of physical project.
Basically OpenSCAD + Clojure + Physics Simulation + Realtime Graphics!

Now featuring \*raytracing\*!!!
And OpenGL support!

## Demo

This project features a raytracing engine for predicting the path of the laser beam. Unfortunately, the rendering is done in OpenSCAD still. I plan on switching to OpenGL for native support in the future, but in the meantime, please enjoy the following gifs of the raytracing functionality. I'm pretty proud of it -- it computes the normals of the surface, and the vector of reflection. It uses the clojure (lazy-seq) macro. Check out the code :).
